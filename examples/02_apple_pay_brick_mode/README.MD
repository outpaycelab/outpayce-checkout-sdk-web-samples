# 02 Integration using Brick Mode within Angular frontend

Sample application to integrate the Outpayce Checkout SDK using the Brick mode.

For the example I will use Angular as a frontend.

I will also filter out the methods of payment to display only Apple Pay. Goal is to show you how the brick mode can be integrated aside of other payment forms you may want to manage on your side.


## Apple Pay Pre-requisites

As you may know, to allow Apple Pay to work, there is a list of requirements that your app may match.

Mainly it needs to be on:
- Safari browser
- https

This is why this repository is serving the UI on https.

Please check on the [Apple Website](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/apple_pay_on_the_web) for all other requirements.

## Pre-requisites

- Generate a PPID with our Payment Checkout Experience: https://developers.amadeus.com/functional-doc-rest/103
- Replace the PPID generated by the server `ppid: '<PPID>',` by a valid one that has been generated.
- Replace the environment `environment: '<ENV>',` by the targeted one (usually `prd` for production, don't forget to update the js and css links as well)
